    "In software engineering, we use **Environment Variables** (like `ENV` and `DATABASE_URL`) to keep our code flexible and secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of them like **\"Settings\"** for your app that live outside the code. This way, you don't have to change your code when you move from your laptop to a real server.\n",

    "### 1. `ENV=development`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **The Usage Example:**\n",
    "Inside your FastAPI code, you might want to show detailed error messages while you are coding, but hide them from real users for security.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",

    "Instead of writing your password directly in your Python file (which is dangerous!), you do this:\n",
    "**In your `.env` file (on your computer):**\n",
    "`DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password123@localhost:5432/rag_db`\n",

If a container is only listening to its own `localhost`, your computer can't \"talk\" to it. Setting this to `0.0.0.0` tells the container to open its doors to the Docker network and your host machine.\n",

    "* **Why you need it:** If your Next.js code fetches data *on the server* (inside a Server Component), it is inside the Docker network. It doesn't know what `localhost:8000` is. It only knows that there is a neighbor container named `backend`.\n",
